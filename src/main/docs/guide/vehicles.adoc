Let's start with a `Vehicles` component, which will render a table of our Vehicle instances.

Create a new JavaScript file under `src/main/webapp/app/` called `Vehicles.js`.

Here's our `Vehicles` component:

[source,javascript]
----
include::{sourceDir}/src/main/webapp/app/Vehicles.js[]
----

Note that in the `renderVehicleRow` function we are accessing the customized JSON representation of our Vehicle instances, so we can use `vehicle.make.name`, for example.

The React profile includes http://react-bootstrap.github.io[React-Bootstrap] by default, so we're using the Bootstrap `Table` component to streamline our code.
